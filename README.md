# Kali-Setup

#Fully automated bash script to setup your Kali system, Tested on Kali 2016.2 Vmware x64.

This idea came to me while taking the OSCP.  I took my own initiative to create this script, though it's far from perfect,I created this script as part of continuing my education, as a result I applied several different methodologies in creating it.

I borrowed several lines from g0tmi1ks script though most of the lines are available open source on the net.


Some of the repos are included in the full Kali Distro, I also added additional software in order to fix several known issues with Kali
